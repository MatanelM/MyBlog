## Daily Fetch and Save

If you prefer to use a standalone cron job with a curl GET request, you can set it up directly on your server without involving Laravel. Hereâ€™s how:

### Step 1: Open Your Crontab

Open the crontab file for your user:

```bash
crontab -e
```
### Step 2: Add the Cron Job for a Daily Curl Request

Add a new line to define the cron job. For example, to run the curl request every day at midnight, add:

```bash
0 0 * * * curl -X GET "https://your-endpoint-url.com" > /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Step 3: Save and Exit

Save and close the crontab file.
